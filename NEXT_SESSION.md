# Next Session Quick Start ðŸš€

## Current State (v2.2.0)
- âœ… **App is LIVE**: https://mcp-call-analyzer-production.up.railway.app
- âœ… **Database**: Working perfectly after schema cache refresh
- âœ… **API**: Processing calls with mock transcription
- âœ… **Railway**: Auto-deploy fixed (use FULL commit hash!)

## What's Working
```bash
# Test the live API
curl -X POST https://mcp-call-analyzer-production.up.railway.app/api/process-call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "call_id": "test-001",
    "customer_name": "Test Customer",
    "customer_number": "555-1234",
    "recording_url": "https://example.com/test.mp3"
  }'
```

## Next Priority: Implement Deepgram Transcription

### Quick Start Code
```python
# In app.py, replace the mock transcription function:
async def transcribe_audio(audio_url: str, deepgram) -> str:
    """Transcribe audio using Deepgram"""
    try:
        if not deepgram:
            # Fallback to mock
            return f"[Mock transcript] Audio URL: {audio_url}"
            
        # Download audio file
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(audio_url)
            audio_data = response.content
        
        # Transcribe with Deepgram
        options = {
            "punctuate": True,
            "diarize": True,
            "language": "en-US",
            "model": "nova-2"
        }
        
        # For Deepgram v3.x
        response = await deepgram.transcription.prerecorded(
            {"buffer": audio_data, "mimetype": "audio/mp3"},
            options
        )
        
        # Extract transcript
        transcript = response["results"]["channels"][0]["alternatives"][0]["transcript"]
        return transcript
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Deepgram error: {e}")
        return f"[Transcription failed] {str(e)}"
```

### Test Audio Files
- Sample MP3: https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3
- Speech sample: https://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/american/OSR_us_000_0010_8k.wav

## Environment Variables Needed
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=1b072fce468f7a7f27bba2a16b0b80f4675300a1  # Already set in Railway
```

## Deployment Reminder
```bash
# ALWAYS use full commit hash!
git add -A && git commit -m "Add Deepgram transcription"
git push
git rev-parse HEAD  # Get FULL hash
# Then trigger deployment with full hash in Railway
```

## Quick Wins for Next Session
1. **Implement Deepgram** - 2-3 hours
2. **Test with real audio** - 30 mins
3. **Add cost tracking** - 1 hour
4. **Create usage dashboard** - 2 hours
